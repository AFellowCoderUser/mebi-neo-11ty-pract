## Greetings, random user on the net!

I welcome you to my small side of the web on [Neocities](https://neocities.org)! You may call me Mebiae as you're here. I like doing art if I'm not lazy (still improving), play games, and do programming! I'm yet to decide what to put on this website, as I'm kinda blank on ideas right now.

I made this website because it would be very cool of me making my own website! This website is also made for the purpose of building my knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also the place where I waste my motivation on working on this site rather than pouring all of that motivation on art. This site wouldn't be a thing if it weren't for the many coding resources and references out there on the net! This site is constantly being worked on, so check back at another time whenever you're feeling like it!
