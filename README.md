# mebi-neo-11ty

11ty'd version of my [website](https://afellowu.neocities.org/).

For the original un-11ty'd of my site, visit [here](https://github.com/AFellowCoderUser/mebi-neocities).

For the sake of me remembering what file's purpose is, I'll write it below.

`src` is where the site's files are held in. Is also the main folder when the site gets compiled.

`_includes` is what holds most of the Nunjucks and/or Liquid files. 

`layouts` holds the base layouts. These are like template files.

`partials` contains code snippet files that can be aquired by other files.
